# Phase 1: Foundation - Detailed Implementation Plan

This document provides detailed guidance for implementing the Foundation phase of the Sesh-Tracker.com project.

## Overview

The Foundation phase establishes the core infrastructure, authentication system, and UI component library that will serve as the basis for all future development. This phase focuses on setting up a solid, well-structured codebase with proper configuration, clear patterns, and essential functionality.

## Key Focus Areas

### 1. Project Setup & Configuration

#### Configuration Files
- Review and update `tsconfig.json` for strict TypeScript settings
- Configure `vite.config.ts` with appropriate build settings and aliases
- Update `tailwind.config.js` with custom theme settings
- Set up testing infrastructure with Vitest

#### Folder Structure
Implement or refine the following structure:
```
src/
├── components/ (reusable UI components)
├── features/ (feature-specific components and logic)
├── hooks/ (custom React hooks)
├── services/ (API services and data access)
├── utils/ (utility functions and helpers)
├── types/ (TypeScript type definitions)
├── context/ (React context providers)
├── styles/ (global styles and Tailwind imports)
└── pages/ (page components)
```

#### Documentation
- Update README with setup instructions
- Document code organization patterns
- Create contributing guidelines

### 2. Authentication Integration

#### Kush.observer Integration
- Create authentication service that communicates with Kush.observer
- Implement token storage and retrieval
- Add token refresh mechanism
- Create auth context provider for global state

#### UI Components
- Build login form with validation
- Create registration form with validation
- Implement password reset flow
- Add loading and error states

#### Protected Routes
- Create authentication guard component
- Set up protected routes in the router
- Implement redirect logic for unauthenticated users

### 3. Base UI Components

#### Design System
- Define color palette, spacing scale, and typography
- Create design tokens (CSS variables)
- Implement dark mode theming

#### Core Components
##### Button Component
- Primary, secondary, tertiary variants
- Loading states
- Icon support
- Size variations

##### Form Controls
- Text input
- Select dropdown
- Checkbox and radio
- Form validation

##### Card Component
- Basic card container
- Card with header/footer
- Interactive card

##### Navigation Elements
- Main navigation bar
- Sidebar
- Breadcrumbs
- Tabs

##### Modal System
- Basic modal
- Dialog with actions
- Drawer component

#### Layout Templates
- Default page layout
- Dashboard layout
- Settings page layout

### 4. Data Schema & State Management

#### Core Data Models
- User profile
- Session data
- Inventory item
- User preferences

#### API Service Layer
- Create base API client with error handling
- Implement services for each resource type
- Add caching strategy

#### State Management
- Set up React context for global state
- Implement local state management patterns
- Create custom hooks for data access

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Week 1**: Project setup, configuration, and folder structure
2. **Week 2**: Authentication integration and protected routes
3. **Week 3**: UI component library and layout templates

## Technical Considerations

- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- Implement proper error handling throughout the application
- Ensure responsive design from the beginning
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Document component usage with examples

## Definition of Done

The Foundation phase is considered complete when:

- The project can be built and run locally without errors
- Users can register, log in, and access protected routes
- The UI component library includes all core components
- The codebase follows consistent patterns and is well-documented
- Basic tests are implemented for critical functionality
