# Sesh-Tracker Development Plan

This directory contains the planning documents, task breakdowns, and progress tracking for the Sesh-Tracker.com project development.

## Directory Structure

- `README.md` - This file, providing an overview of the development plan
- `TODO.md` - Master task list organized by development phases
- `ROADMAP.md` - Long-term development roadmap with milestones
- `phases/` - Detailed plans for each development phase
  - Phase 1: Foundation
  - Phase 2: Core Functionality
  - Phase 3: Enhanced Features
  - Phase 4: Refinement & Optimization

## Purpose

The development plan documents serve multiple purposes:
1. Provide clear direction and priorities for development work
2. Break down the vision into manageable implementation tasks
3. Track progress against planned milestones
4. Document decisions made during the development process
5. Support collaboration between team members and the AI assistant

## How to Use

- Reference the `TODO.md` file for the current prioritized tasks
- Check phase-specific documents in the `phases/` directory for detailed implementation guidance
- Update task status as work progresses
- Document significant decisions or changes to the plan

## Development Methodology

This project follows an iterative development approach:
- Start with a minimum viable product (MVP) focusing on core functionality
- Continuously refine and enhance features based on testing and feedback
- Prioritize modularity to support future extensions and integration
- Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout the development cycle
