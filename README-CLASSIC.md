# Classic SeshTracker Integration

The original SeshTracker web application has been integrated into the new React framework in a way that preserves all functionality while maintaining the new codebase structure.

## How to Access the Classic Version

There are multiple ways to access the classic SeshTracker:

1. **From the main app**: Click the "Open Classic SeshTracker" button on the homepage
2. **Direct access**: Navigate to `/classic/index.html` or `/classic.html`

## Implementation Details

- All original files are preserved in the `public/classic/` directory
- The original JavaScript, CSS, and HTML are kept intact
- Google Ads integration is maintained
- Local storage data is preserved
- All charts and functionality work as before

## Technical Notes

- The classic version runs completely independently from the React application
- No changes were made to the original code
- The ads.txt file has been duplicated at the root level to ensure ad delivery

## Future Considerations

As development of the new SeshTracker version continues, you may want to:

1. Gradually migrate features from classic to the new React version
2. Import user data from the classic to the new version
3. Add more prominent links between versions

But for now, everything works as expected with both versions coexisting.
