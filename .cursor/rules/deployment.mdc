# Deployment Process Rule

When the user asks to "deploy to production", "push to prod", "update the website", "deploy", or any similar request related to deploying the application, always follow this exact deployment sequence:

1. **Verify Changes**:
   - Ensure all code changes are complete and tested locally
   - Check that authentication with Kush.Observer is working properly
   - Verify any environment-specific configuration is set for production

2. **Commit to GitHub**:
   - Run `git add .` to stage all changes
   - Create a descriptive commit with `git commit -m "meaningful commit message"`
   - Push to the main branch with `git push origin main`

3. **Build and Deploy**:
   - Use the full deployment script: `.\full-deploy.ps1` (Windows) or `./full-deploy.sh` (Linux/macOS)
   - If separate steps are needed:
     a. Install dependencies: `npm ci --production`
     b. Build the frontend: `npm run build`
     c. Run linting and type checks: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck`
     d. Deploy to Cloudflare: `npx wrangler deploy --env production`

4. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check the production site at https://sesh-tracker.com
   - Verify the API health endpoint at https://sesh-tracker.com/api/health
   - Test authentication using the test account (tester@email.com / Superbowl9-Veggie0-Credit4-Watch1)
   - Verify critical functionality (sessions, inventory, user profile)

5. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**:
   - Monitor application for 15-30 minutes after deployment
   - Check Cloudflare logs for any errors or unusual patterns
   - Verify all production environment variables are correctly set

6. **Rollback Procedure (if needed)**:
   - If issues are discovered, use `npx wrangler rollback --version=VERSION_ID` to revert
   - For frontend issues, revert in Cloudflare Pages dashboard

The deployment MUST use the wrangler.json configuration with the `--env production` flag to ensure the correct Cloudflare Worker settings are applied.

Always document deployment details including date, time, changes, and any issues encountered.
