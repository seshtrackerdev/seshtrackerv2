## ‚úÖ Scripts

### `setup-structure.sh`
Initializes directory layout, `.env.example`, and stub files for new projects.

### `test-connection.js`
Performs a multi-step test against Kush.Observer and SeshTracker:
- Health check on both APIs
- Login test with test credentials
- Token validation
- Inventory access with auth

### `apply-migration.js`
Applies a SQL schema file to the D1 database both locally and remotely using Wrangler.

### `update-imports.sh` / `update-imports.ps1`
Normalizes imports to use `index.ts` barrel-style paths. Cleans up fragile relative imports and improves consistency.

### `verify-imports.sh` / `verify-imports.ps1`
Analyzes all React files for:
- Deep relative imports
- Missing extensions
- Direct component file usage
